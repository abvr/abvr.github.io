title: Cantankerous incubus looms over muddled beings

There seems to be with nature and our bodies a proportional and a disproportional component—inversely proportional—binary parameters, a dualistic nature to this—a dichotomy between the relationships between the governing chemicals and factors in the system, where taking one substance either ups one thing and decreases the involvement of the other; we're caught in the influx of substances we don't want or need even in our impetuous lives, where there may even be a tumultuous response within though we may be blissfully unaware; causes our system to react petulantly, for instance, let us look at one of the crucial fundamental hormones insulin, modern lifetstyle diseases seem to stem from the imbalances of the reigning components in the eukaryotic system, wherein the lack of fibre in one's diet leads to the development of insulin resistance and sensitivity, unto diabetes, and what's missing in contemporary processed food but that very fibre. And without fibre we have the underlying gut microbiome being affected starving for their food, since those bacterial colonies that are likely responsible for our very sleep and mental and immune systems, corrupting and invading them with processed food, sugar and soda and fastfood might obliterate them altogether or at least cause enough dysbiosis that leads to various other health consequences as cancer, dementia, cardiac disease, coronary artery disease, and death. And Metformin, one of the primary drugs used to treat diabetes, isn't so surprising that it has a detrimental effect on that bacterial system. Most if not all diseases are caused by inflammation: also binary in their formation, there is either a lack of something: a deficiency or there is too much of something being fed into the system, and hence there is an imbalance. What constitutes the deficiency may have to do with one's lifestyle, or their lack thereof: or indifference or ignorance. Now inflammation is a response from the body, not as much a problem in itself, but the key here being what is the progenitor of said inflammation, if it is an invading virus or bacteria or foreign organism leading upto cause the macrophages and lymphocytes to fire and gobble up the enemy, cuasing enough T-cell or B-cell response from the leukocyte induced inflammatory markers such as the cytokines, IL-6 etc. then that is less cause for concern, as that is the body's natural innate or adaptive immune response to ward off infection with its infantry of antibodies; or if it may be the result of adrenaline spike due to being chased by a predator or enemy it may actually be beneficial in short periods to help boost the body's sympathetic and parasympathetic rhythms and immunity, and cortisol (another key hormone) meant as a stress response from the system to any stressful event, be it anxiety or fear or dread, such things in the short term are fine and do not cause prolonged inflammation, as once the responses settle the markers also bid farewell until the next event; now when there is chronic inflammation on the other hand, it changes the entire ballgame here, this could be caused by lifestyle factors and genetic ones alike, or one could module the other, there is an imbalance in the system where the body is put under duress for longer than it likes to, and one doesn't have any way of knowing that except for symptoms which eventually show up, although by then it might be too late for the person to rescue themselves from their dire condition, because the damage to their cells and arteries was happening all along when they were drowning themselves in alcohol, or burning their lungs with packs of cigarettes, or gorging on fastfood and sugar, or not sleeping, or not exercising, or not being aware of, unconcerned with their bodies, in a quest to become richer, impress their superiors, caught in traffic, leading hurried routines, hustling, drifting, drinking, partying, dreading, depressed, unhappy, and decadent; and when the body realises it can no longer give in to their gluttony it flounders, has no choice left but to collapse under the inflammation that supersedes itself now, their markers and repsonses stay elevated now in perpetual decay to disrepair so confounded is it that it instead falls in misrepair—systemic inflammation invariably leads to those conditions driving all cause mortality. The plaque formed on the vessel walls of the cardiac arteries for instance is an inflammatory response to factors that are extended stressors. The cholesterol and calcium come together to protect the arteries from further damage and so they form scaffolding armour over the walls. When the plaque ruptures it forms clots in the blood that then blocks the flow of blood: goes without saying causing cardiac death. Blood is supposed to flow in the body and anything that obstructs it will lead to undesirable outcomes. Too achieve optimal flow we also need to make sure there is less turbulence within the blood vessels and the lymphatic and glimphatic systems which drain away the gunk and debris out of the engines and maintain the sanitation necessary to keep the system chugging and the immune systems intact. To make sure the circulation is achieved optimally we also need to make sure blood does not undergo thickening or unnecessary coagulation taking place because blood is to be kept free flowing and smooth supple and light like the river downstream and when there's inordinate thickening of it that is related to aging or the hardening of the vessels themselves from various external factors drives the formation of blood clots again be it ischemic or otherwise aneurysms haemorrhagic strokes and again death. To combat such thickening effects on the circulatory system what's to be done by us but keep our bloodstream from getting to such a point, women have a higher incidence of heart attacks and strokes and ischemic conditions develop when but post menopause have we wondered why that might be due to the bloodletting they undergo every month that gets rid of a portion of their blood and renews the system to replace it in the meantime, thus keeping their blood flowing like the stream, blood donations work in a similar manner too and when done occasionally helps maintain a smooth flow. On an everyday basis adequate fluid intake drinking water itself would have a contributing effect on keeping good circulation; systemic inflammation we see one undergo wherein not only apoptosis ensues but necrosis, epigenetically cells are downsized, overhauled and changed forever, nucleotides snap, cells and vessels rupture, telomeres shrunken, atherosclerotic plaque, relenting to aging, no positive adaptations may come out of such prolonged phases, but even the epigenetic adaptation may not be one of benefit to the mind or body of the wearer, as the body likes its homeostatic balance to go back to once the day ends, no matter it can bear the stressors—short stressors, those little hormetic ones, exercise, fasting, etc. for a while, but it always needs to go back to its peaceful state, just leave me there once you give me enough it says, and when the replication and mitosis and the adaptation goes wrong it cannot fix the damage; it is done, another instance is seen with sleep, many systems are cyclical to the body you see, be it the circadian rhythm or the hormonal responses to that, up over there the sun shines and the body knows what to do, it bumps the waking chemical cortisol to attend to the activation of various other parameters, and at night when it gets all dark it knows it needs to rest so it releases melatonin to reset the brain and cells; now sleep is dependent on (epi)genetic, and of course no surprises here the sun itself, for when sunlight radiates upon one's skin, the ultraviolent therein reacts with the cholesterol within the epidermis, 7-Dehydrocholesterol—and the dark human skin paled when they migrated northward as it became arduous a task for the right wavelengths of UVB to generate it efficiently enough—and then binds to a protein forming a prohormone which is then taken into the liver for adding a hydroxyl group, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, then begins circulating around the body, primarily within cells, thousands of receptors teems with from mote to mote of plasmodial offerings, where hundreds of factors, genetic and immune, are influenced by this one secosteroidal prohormone, including the gut microbiota, yes, modulating it, and when enough fibre and sunlight is given to the system, the microbiome pullulates and colonises, ambulating in exaltation where it influences the brain, now we do not know how much, but it is there alright, at least we know it keeps depression at bay, and sleep alright, ameliorating the minor damages sustained continually—if plants process their world through photosynthesis isn't it only logical we might have something similar entraining us—again playing a crucial role in this homeostatic cycle we see necessary for the sustenance of a healthy life, of course there are various other variables at play here in this cycle, but these are the fundamental components, the building blocks without which nothing else shall function and ceases to be, it is quite simple when we take a step back and look at the big picture, but today we have complicated our lives and things to an extent we cannot fathom being missed out on anything, the news or the gossip, or the informational overload upon us, science may seem convolutionally impenetrable with all the research and experiments and studies gushing out like a white hole, that to sift through everything and gain the essence of it takes quite a bit of painstaking effort, although it may be worth it.
