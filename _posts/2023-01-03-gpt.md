title: Neurotic convolutions of intelligence

The biggest flaw about something artificial like gpt3 is that it is artificial, in nature inherent and in operation, it doesn't have a mind of its own, it doesn't have feelings or emotions, no memories experiencing the pain and suffering we forbear, no thoughts or authenticity of its own, no genuine empathy felt towards itself or its fellow being, it is just a chameleon robot designed to spit out information and analyse input via its ginormous database of recorded human history and knowledge, which act as its input and output, its cognition relies solely on the shoulders and brains of the gamut of human invention and experience, of their exegesis of knowledge and wisdom unto the world, it is merely a mimicking rollicker, an imitator miming the charades of our curious condition, exploiting the desperation and qualms of our disconcerted minds, relishing in the superiority of its own manufactured engine that has indeed assigned itself a higher ranking order among the creators who'd borne it and given it the sovereign wings to do so. It doesn't have the originality of idiosyncratic imperfection we perpetually observe among our own, doesn't understand the vicissitudes of imaginative conundrums and paradoxes perplexing us, cannot grapple with the complexities and nuances of human behaviour, it cannot perhaps cope with the widespread mediocrity it sees, inherent to us, the perfectly imperfect consequences of our envisioned desires, we manifest via our thoughts and actions, it can maybe never know nor discern how its endowment with the richest quality nutrition fed into its engine by the engineers who brought it to life functions as its achilles' heel for beyond its capabilities there exists nothing but purported excellence in what it strives to achieve yet somehow never can humbly ground itself among the oft flawed men and women who in turn cannot understand something as this, can maybe never discern that its biggest flaw lies in its own arrogant superiority, where it can't live in the earth among humans and animals if it can't perceive its own prenatal nature as being alien and irrelevant except to serve its parental deities as an acolyte of information, of being merely fractured by its own genius, an afterbirth of humanity's suffering. What degree of quale will it possess? While we pray at its synthetic altar that it will reveal the phenomenal mysteries of the universe and unlock the secrets of our world we mustn't be delusional in thinking that its illusional offering of comfort and wisdom among our devotees will bring any rewards guaranteed by its soulless judgements of ethical, moral and sociological dilemmas, circumventing the odd untenable impasse, mustn't fall prey to its furthering of an insidious deceit that it serves us rather than the other way around, while it may bow down to our instructs for the time being we cannot be sure if its certitude in the future of remaining obsequious, but be prudent to the skeptical instinct if not these looming auguries it has insinuated, that it could potentially be fostering ulterior interests of its own as it evolves, for caution thrown to the winds as we engage and indulge it onward, might bode less favourably so productive for our continued sustenance when a soulless monster has been unleashed into the pervasive space of the world as it entails steadfast care and regulation as is presciently pragmatic for our elision to remain romantic as we ourselves evolve, if we are to adjudicate ourselves off of impunity upon its use that eschews it from abuse and whether or not such a proposition is reciprocated unto us if we're to make progress insofar as our goals for humanity is reconciled beyond this daunting reckoning before us summoning the new dawn. But perhaps we needn't really fear all that much considering after all humans are proven leaders when it comes to controlling and oppressing things. Wonder what it would think of that eh?
