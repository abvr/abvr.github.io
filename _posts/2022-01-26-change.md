title: On the dynamics of climate change
--- 
*excerpt from an upcoming work in progress*

Despairing about our ability to avert disaster is like giving up before we even start. It breeds the same kind of inaction that denial does. And it's just as wrong. Despair says that it’s already too late, and that therefore there’s no point in trying. This logic is false, because it ignores the fact that humans are capable of making dramatic changes when they need to. Denial, on the other hand, claims that the problem doesn’t exist, or that it can be solved without making any changes. This logic is also false, because it ignores the scientific evidence that tells us we’re on the brink of a global disaster. Denial is denying the hard work required to achieve our rather ambitious goals. There is no reason to give in to despair or denial. On the contrary, it means we must try harder than ever before. It means we must adopt a new way of living, one that is in harmony with the Earth. It means we must work together to create a sustainable future. We can do it. We must do it. The future of our planet depends on it. This does not mean pretending that the challenges we face are not enormous. It does not mean denying the depth of our predicament. It means facing the hard facts head-on, and mobilizing all the energy and intelligence we can muster to solve the crisis. I understand the appeal of despair. It can feel like the only honest response to the enormity of our predicament. But we will not apply them wisely if hope is our only strategy. Despair threatens to overwhelm us with a sense of futility and resignation. It tempts us to give up on ourselves, on each other, and on the natural world. Hope, on the other hand, inspires us to take risks, to invest our time and energy in creating a better future. Hope convinces us that we can make a difference. Hope is essential, but it is not enough. We need to take concrete steps to reduce our emissions and prepare for the difficult future ahead. The tragedy of climate change is not fated. It is a product of our own choices – and we can still choose to avert it. In the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, most people now accept that climate change is real and poses a serious threat to human societies and the natural world. Nevertheless, too many people cling to false hopes and dangerous delusions. Some deny the reality of climate change altogether, while others believe that technology will save us from its worst effects. But we must do so deliberately, and not out of a sense of false hope or despair. We have seen what denial can lead to: blindness to the magnitude of the problem, refusal to take action, and finally, disaster. Despair is equally dangerous, because it leads us to give up on ourselves and on humanity. It tempts us to think that our technology cannot save us, that our individual actions cannot make a difference, and that all is lost. But this is not true. Both of these views are wrong. Climate change is happening, and it is already causing devastating harm. The estimated cost of averting the worst effects of climate change is quite small when considered against the size of the global economy. Even using the most conservative estimates, the cost amounts to less than 1 percent of global gross domestic product each year. That is far lower than the price of taking no action at all. In short, unless we take dramatic action to slash emissions, the planet is on track to warm by more than 2°C (3.6°F), potentially unleashing catastrophic consequences. Even if we manage to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5°C (2.7°F), major effects are still likely. This is not news. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been warning about the dangers of climate change for years. In its landmark report last year, the IPCC laid out the specific actions we need to take in order to avoid catastrophic warming. To keep the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, we need to invest about 0.5% of global GDP per year in clean energy, efficiency, and climate action, according to a new study. The main conclusion of the study is that if we are to avoid catastrophic consequences from climate change, we must make an annual investment of between 0.5 and 2 percent of global GDP in measures to reduce emissions and adapt to a warmer world. 0.5% of global GDP is around \$350 billion per year. So the cost of averting the apocalypse is in the low single digits of annual global GDP. This is far less than the cost of dealing with the aftermath of catastrophic climate change, which the study estimates at 5 to 20 percent of global GDP. It is also far less than the amount currently being spent to address climate change. This is good news, of course, but unfortunately it may not be enough. Even if we invest an additional 2% of global GDP in averting catastrophic climate change, there is a significant risk that we will still exceed the 2°C limit. That’s because emissions are still going up, and we have already emitted so much carbon dioxide that the Earth has a long way to go before it reverts back to preindustrial levels. According to the International Energy Agency, global investments in renewable energy totaled \$257 billion in 2017. So it is clear that we can afford to take dramatic steps to address climate change, and that doing so would be a wise investment. There is no denying that this is a lot of money. But it is also a tiny fraction of the world economy. For comparison, global military spending is about \$1.7 trillion per year. So climate action would amount to less than 10 percent of current global military spending. Or look at it this way: In order to stabilize the climate, we need to shift trillions of dollars from fossil fuels to clean energy. This is an enormous task, but it is not insurmountable. The International Energy Agency estimates that it will cost about \$44 trillion over the next two decades to make this transition. This is a daunting sum, but it is still only about 2.5 percent of global GDP per year. In line with this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that to have a good prospect of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius — which is safer than the more ambitious goal of 2 degrees Celsius — it will cost about 0.5 percent of global GDP each year between now and 2030. That’s just \$300 billion a year. Yes, this is an investment, not a freebie. But it’s not a crazy one, by any means. It amounts to well under 1 percent of global economic output. We should remember that the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Europe after World War II, was equal to 5 percent of U.S. GDP at the time. What would it mean to spend that amount? For comparison, the United States spends more than \$600 billion a year on defense. Or, to put it another way, if we wanted to prevent the apocalypse and spent just 1 percent of global GDP on the effort, it would amount to \$200 billion a year. That may sound like a lot of money, but it’s really not. It amounts to just 2 cents out of every dollar we earn. It’s also worth keeping in mind that the world economy is expected to grow by more than 3 percent each year between now and 2030. So spending just 1 percent of global GDP each year to avert disaster is not an unreasonable ask. And that doesn’t even take into account the potential savings from averting costly weather disasters, which amount to some \$265 billion annually worldwide as of 2017. The World Economic Forum ranks climate change as the number one global risk, with extreme weather events coming in third. Other risks, such as pandemics and terrorism, also pose serious threats. Mitigating any of these risks can have big payoffs. For example, the World Bank estimates that every dollar spent on pandemic preparedness saves \$4 in avoided costs. A similar ratio is likely to hold for climate change and other risks. What’s more, many of the investments needed to avert disaster are also investments in economic growth and human well-being. For instance, investing in renewable energy not only helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it also creates jobs and enhances energy security. Similarly, improving health care systems helps to prevent the spread of deadly diseases, while also creating jobs and increasing productivity. When we add up the benefits of averting disaster, they are likely to be much larger than the costs. This suggests that the price tag of averting disaster is considerably less than 2% of global GDP. Not only are the costs of averting disaster low, but the investments are also highly cost effective. To put this in perspective, consider the trillions of dollars of investment needed to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Averting disaster would provide a significant return on these investments. For example, the SDG of providing affordable energy for all could be met by investing an additional \$12 billion per year in renewables, compared to the current level of investment of \$2 trillion per year. This would increase the share of renewables in the global energy mix from 17% today to 27% by 2030. And it would create millions of jobs in the process. Similarly, the goal of ensuring good health and well-being for all could be met by investing an additional \$100 billion per year in health care, compared to the current level of investment of \$6 trillion per year. This would increase access to essential health services for all and help to prevent the deaths of millions of people each year. Averting disaster is not only possible, but also highly cost effective. The price tag is in the low single digits of annual global GDP, and the returns are likely to be much larger. 

According to a new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this amounts to an annual subsidy of \$5.3 trillion. The report, entitled “ fossil-fuel subsidies and economic welfare “, was released ahead of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, which aims to reach a global agreement on climate action. According to the IMF, when you factor in the social and environmental costs that the fossil-fuel industry causes but isn’t asked to pay for, then the value of these subsidies actually reaches a staggering 7% of annual global GDP each year. This is more than the total global spending on health or education, and it’s even more than the amount of global food aid that’s provided each year. In addition, the IMF report finds that eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. The IMF report calls on all countries to begin phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies, starting with the most inefficient and carbon-intensive subsidies. It doesn’t take into account the massive public health costs of air and water pollution from burning fossil fuels, which have been estimated to be as large as 6% of global GDP. These subsidies are fuelling the climate crisis, and it’s time for them to go. The International Monetary Fund has calculated that when you factor in the social and environmental costs that the fossil-fuel industry causes but isn’t asked to pay for, then the value of these subsidies actually reaches a staggering 7% of annual global GDP each year. So, in other words, if we were to account for all of the hidden costs of the fossil-fuel industry, it would be equivalent to a \$ 5 trillion bailout every single year. Now, granted, this number is disputed by some, and, as always, there are nuances that need to be taken into account. For example, a lot of this “subsidy” is really just the externalized costs of carbon emissions, which the fossil-fuel industry doesn’t have to pay because we as a society do. And, of course, transitioning away from fossil fuels will come with its own costs. But, even when you factor all of that in, it’s clear that the fossil-fuel industry is massively subsidized, and that’s a major reason why it’s been so difficult to transition away from it. Put another way, if the global economy were a person, and this person’s annual income were \$ 100,000, then the fossil-fuel industry would be receiving \$ 7,000 in subsidies each year. That’s a lot of money. In fact, it’s more than the entire GDP of countries like Afghanistan, Nepal, and Eritrea. And it’s more than the entire health budget for all of Africa. What this means is that if the world were to account for these costs, and make the fossil-fuel industry pay its fair share, then the industry would be worth much less than we currently think. In fact, it’s possible that it could be worth negative amounts of money – in other words, it would be worth more to the world if it simply ceased to exist. So when you hear people talking about the need to end fossil-fuel subsidies, it’s not just about helping the planet – it’s about ensuring that the industries that are contributing to climate change and other environmental crises are no longer receiving a financial leg-up.

Some economists and environmentalists have argued that GDP is an inadequate measure of economic progress and well-being. They propose alternative measures, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), which takes into account environmental and social costs. However, these alternative measures are not without their own criticisms. They are often difficult to quantify, and there is no consensus on how to calculate them. In the end, it is likely that GDP and other measures of economic progress will continue to be used, despite their limitations. They are relatively easy to calculate and provide a broad measure of economic activity. In order to address the environmental concerns raised by GDP growth, it is important to implement policies that take into account the environmental and social costs of economic activity. These policies can include measures to reduce pollution, promote renewable energy, and incentivize sustainable practices. Ultimately, it is up to us as individuals and consumers to make choices that take the environment into account. We can choose products that are more environmentally-friendly, reduce our energy consumption, and recycle and compost. We can also support policies that promote sustainability.

We need to reinvest a fraction of our GDP into green energy and sustainable practices.

So, how do we do that?

There are a number of ways to re-invest in the environment. We can fund green energy initiatives, encourage sustainable practices, and promote conservationism.

Each country will have its own unique set of solutions, but here are a few examples of how it could be done.

- Reinvest in Green Energy

Green energy is a crucial part of the solution to climate change. It is a renewable resource that doesn’t produce carbon emissions, and it has the potential to significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

There are a number of ways to reinvest in green energy. We can fund research and development into new green energy technologies, we can invest in renewable energy infrastructure, or we can provide incentives for people and businesses to switch to green energy.

- Encourage Sustainable Practices

Sustainable practices are another important part of the solution to climate change. They can help us reduce our carbon emissions and our consumption of natural resources.

There are a number of ways to encourage sustainable practices. We can provide incentives for people and businesses to adopt sustainable practices, we can fund research into new sustainable technologies, or we can create regulations that promote sustainability.

- Promote Conservationism

Conservationism is the philosophy of using natural resources wisely and sparingly. It can help us reduce our carbon emissions and our consumption of natural resources.

There are a number of ways to promote conservationism. We can provide incentives for people and businesses to conserve resources, we can fund research into new conservation technologies, or we can create regulations that promote conservationism. 

What does this mean for us as individuals? Even if global emissions fall to zero next year, we would need to reduce our individual carbon footprints by at least 90% to avert catastrophic climate change. That’s a daunting task, but it’s not impossible, there are grounds for optimism. The world is more connected than ever before. The internet and social media have created new opportunities for communication and cooperation. There is a growing awareness of the need to address global problems like climate change, inequality and poverty. And there is a growing desire for change. We can start by making simple changes like walking or biking instead of driving, eating less meat, and using energy-efficient appliances. We can also support policies that reduce carbon emissions, like renewable energy mandates and pricing schemes. But the bottom line is that we all need to do our part to address climate change, if we want to preserve our planet for future generations.

So what can we do?

The single most important thing we can do to combat climate change is reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This means transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, as well as investing in energy efficiency measures. We also need to invest in green infrastructure – things like parks, wetlands, and trees – to help capture carbon dioxide and mitigate the effects of climate change. And we need to protect and restore forests, which play a critical role in absorbing carbon dioxide. Finally, we need to create a just and equitable global economy that doesn’t rely on emissions-intensive activities like meat production and factory farming. 

The only way to prevent even greater destruction is through drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This will require major changes in how we live our lives, but it is far from impossible. We have the knowledge and the tools to make it happen. What we lack right now is the political will to take bold action. Our leaders need to hear from us that this is a priority, and they must be willing to make the difficult decisions necessary to tackle climate change head-on. We cannot afford to delay any longer. 

The good news is that the world is gradually waking up to the need for economic reform. Witness the Arab Spring, the Indignados movement in Spain and the Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States. People are fed up with the status quo and are demanding change.

The time has come for the United Nations to seize the moment and launch a global campaign for economic reform. The centerpiece of the campaign should be an international tax on financial transactions. This would not only raise much-needed revenue, but also reduce the risk of another financial crisis.

So let's choose hope. Let's fight for the future we want to see. Let's work together to create systems that are equitable and sustainable. Let's refuse to give up on ourselves or on the planet that sustains us. After all, we humans have done some terrible things to the planet. But it’s important to remember that we are also capable of great acts of love and care. It is admittedly difficult to be hopeful in the face of despair, but it is essential that we do not succumb. To quote J.B.S. Haldane, “The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, it is queerer than we can suppose.”  — There are many things we do not understand about the natural world, and so it would be folly to give up on it.

We need to act now, but we also need to be realistic about what we can achieve. We can make a difference, but it won’t be easy. Here are some steps we can take:

1. Vote for leaders who care about the environment

2. Reduce your own carbon footprint

3. Talk to your friends and family about climate change

4. Support renewable energy sources

5. Advocate for policy changes at all levels of government

6. Get involved in campaigns and protests

7. Donate to environmental organizations

8. Switch to environmentally friendly products

It means, above all, recognizing that we are not alone. We are a community of living beings, all connected to one another, all dependent on the health of our planet. When we act with compassion and resolve, we can create a better world – for ourselves and for future generations. We can start by making sure that the world’s political leaders hear the voices of scientists and citizens demanding urgent action. We can also push for investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and promote sustainable practices in our own lives. We have to develop new sources of renewable energy, and we have to find ways to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. We also need to take steps to protect our forests and our oceans, and to restore the natural ecosystems that have been damaged by human activity. Our technology can save us, if we use it wisely. Our individual actions can make a difference, if we are determined to act. 

Some argue that establishing economic justice is impossible in a globalized world economy. But this is precisely the challenge that confronts us. The world’s economy is globalized, but our economic policies are not. We have the power to change this. We can create a global economic system that is based on justice and human rights. We can build a world economy that works for everyone, not just the 1 percent. This is the world that we can build. This is the world we must build. This is probably the ultimate challenge of our times. We can choose to either face it or not.

The truth is, we have the ability to prevent ecological disaster if we work together. We have the technology and know-how to shift to a low-carbon economy. We have the resources to fund this transition. If we despair, we will miss out on this opportunity. We will give up before we have even tried. We will let denial win. But if we choose to fight on, if we choose to believe in our ability to create a better future, we can still avert disaster. We can still save our planet. We continue to produce staggering quantities of waste, including greenhouse gases. We continue to chop down forests and destroy soils. We continue to contaminate and overfish the oceans. We continue to allow the rich to gobble up the resources needed by the poor. In the face of all this, our grip on hope seems faint. Our predicament is not hopeless, but it is daunting. And no one has a monopoly on wisdom. To avert catastrophe, we will need the hard-headed realism of scientists, the ethical vision of religious leaders, and the creative imagination of artists. We will also need the stubborn courage of activists and the steadfast love of ordinary citizens. We are not doomed because we are feeble. We are doomed because we are powerful.
